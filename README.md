## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of transactional sales data for Maven Roasters, a coffee shop franchise in New York City (NYC).
The primary goal was to transform raw sales data (January - June 2023) into a dynamic, interactive dashboard. This dashboard serves as a strategic tool for franchise owners to better understand customer purchase behaviour, identify key sales patterns, optimise operations, and uncover growth opportunities across their three NYC locations (Astoria, Hell's Kitchen, and Lower Manhattan).

## Business Problem
Maven Roasters needed a clear, data-driven view of their business performance to streamline operations and increase profitability.

## Key Insights and Findings
The analysis and resulting dashboard revealed several critical insights:
- Revenue Growth & Peaks: Total revenue saw a significant upward trend from January to June, with the highest sales volume recorded in June ($166,485.88).
- Peak Operating Hours: The busiest period for transactions consistently falls between 7:00 AM and 10:00 AM, indicating a strong morning rush/commuter market. This suggests opportunities for optimizing staffing levels and preparation during these hours.
- Top Performing Product Category: Coffee is the dominant product category by transaction volume (58,416 transactions), followed by Tea (45,449 transactions).
- Top 3 Products by Revenue:
  - Brewed Chai Tea: $77,081.95
  - Gourmet Brewed Coffee: $70,034.80
  - Barista Espresso: $91,406.20 (Note: Highest revenue product)
- Busiest Days of the Week: Thursdays and Fridays are the busiest days for transactions, potentially linking to the end-of-week work cycle.
## Recommendations
Based on the analysis of the sales data, the following actionable strategies are recommended to the franchise owner to optimize operations and drive revenue:
1. Optimize Peak Hours (7 AM - 10 AM): Increase staffing and implement pre-batching of high-demand items (Coffee, Hot Chocolate) on peak days (Thursdays/Fridays) to maximize customer throughput and reduce wait times.
2. Strategic Revenue Growth: Focus promotional efforts on the highest-revenue product, Barista Espresso, during slower afternoon periods to boost overall transaction value.
3. Increase Transaction Size: Institute a cross-selling initiative where staff recommend top-selling food items (Pastry, Biscotti) with every coffee and tea purchase.
4. Inventory Management: Utilize the daily and hourly sales trends to create precise inventory forecasts, minimizing waste for key high-volume products.
## Tools Used for the project
- Analysis & Visualization: Microsoft Excel.
- Data Preparation: Data cleaning, transformation, and structure were primarily handled within Excel.
- Concepts: Dynamic Slicers, Calculated Fields, PivotTables, and Advanced Charting.
### How to Navigate the Dashboard
#### ***The dashboard is designed for interactive exploration, allowing users to drill down into specific locations or time periods.***
- Open the File: Download the data set from [The Coffee Shop Project.xlsx](the-coffee-shop-project.xlsx)
- Use Slicers: Locate the primary Location Slicer (likely near the top) and click on Astoria, Hell's Kitchen, or Lower Manhattan to instantly filter all charts and metrics to that single location's performance. Click the "Clear Filter" icon (often a funnel with an 'x') to return to the combined view.
- Analyze Trends: Click on a specific Month in the main revenue chart (e.g., June) to see how transaction volume, product sales, and hours of the day looked only in that month.
- Explore Product Detail: Interact directly with the Top 15 Products table. Clicking on a product name (e.g., "Barista Espresso") will filter the rest of the dashboard to show its contribution over time and across locations.
