# Maven-Roasters-Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard
End-to-end data analysis project involving data profiling, cleaning, and visualization. Built a dynamic Excel/Power BI dashboard (use the tool you chose) to track total revenue, transaction volume by hour, and top-selling products for a coffee shop franchise.

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of transactional sales data for Maven Roasters, a coffee shop franchise in New York City (NYC).
The primary goal was to transform raw sales data (January - June 2023) into a dynamic, interactive dashboard. This dashboard serves as a strategic tool for franchise owners to better understand customer purchase behaviour, identify key sales patterns, optimise operations, and uncover growth opportunities across their three NYC locations (Astoria, Hell's Kitchen, and Lower Manhattan).

## Business Problem
*Situation: Recently became a franchise owner of Maven Roasters, a coffee shop chain with three locations in New York City.
*Goals: Transform collected transactional data (Jan-Jun 2023) into a dynamic dashboard for franchise owners to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities.
*Objectives: 
--Profile and prepare the raw data for analysis (ETL).
-- Explore the data using PivotTables (Initial Analysis).
--Build a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard to visualize trends.

## Key Insights and Findings:
The analysis and resulting dashboard revealed several critical insights:
1. Revenue Growth & Peaks: Total revenue saw a significant upward trend from January to June, with the highest sales volume recorded in June ($166,485.88).
2. Peak Operating Hours: The busiest period for transactions consistently falls between 7:00 AM and 10:00 AM, indicating a strong morning rush/commuter market. This suggests opportunities for optimizing staffing levels and preparation during these hours.
3. Top Performing Product Category: Coffee is the dominant product category by transaction volume (58,416 transactions), followed by Tea (45,449 transactions).
4. Top 3 Products by Revenue:
--Brewed Chai Tea: $77,081.95
--Gourmet Brewed Coffee: $70,034.80
--Barista Espresso: $91,406.20 (Note: Highest revenue product)
Busiest Days of the Week: Thursdays and Fridays are the busiest days for transactions, potentially linking to the end-of-week work cycle.
